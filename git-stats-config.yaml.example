# Git Stats Configuration
# List of repositories to analyze
#repos:
#  - "/path/to/repo1"
#  - "/path/to/repo2"
#  - "/path/to/repo3"

# OR instead of specifying individual repos, you can specify a root directory
# and the script will find all git repositories under it
root_dir: "/path/to/root/directory"

# Author to filter commits by
author: "your.email@example.com"

# Patterns for files to exclude
exclude_patterns:
  - "composer.lock"
  - "package-lock.json"
  - "^vendor/"
  - "^node_modules/"
  - "dist/"
  - "build/"
  - "public/build/"

# List of commit hashes to ignore from the statistics
# Eg, for ignoring things like moving a bunch of files around (or whatver)
# Basically any commit that would skew the stats
ignore_commits:
  - "abc1234567890"  # Example commit hash to ignore
  - "def9876543210"  # Another example commit hash

# Optional: Only consider commits more recent than this date
# Examples: "1 month ago", "2023-01-01", or null for all commits
since: null

# Output file paths
